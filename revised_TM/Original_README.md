Visual-Automata-Simulator
=========================

This small application allows to create and simulate any Deterministic or Non-Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA or NFA) as well as Turing Machines (TM).

Features
--------
* Creates, simulates and transforms DFA and NFA machines
* Creates and simulates TM
* Batch tests for TM: useful features to test a bunch of files quickly!
* Easy-to-use GUI interface (multi-documents)
* Smart links between objects
* Machines can be drawn using the mouse - and resized at any time
* Multiple machines can be created in a single document
* Multiple documents can be opened at the same time
* Documents can be saved and reloaded from disk
* Debug mode to see exactly how the machine is working (each step has a different color)
* Export any machine to EPS file
* Mac OS X GUI compliant
